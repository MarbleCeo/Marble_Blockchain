# Marble Blockchain

## Project Overview

Marble Blockchain is a modern hybrid Proof of History (PoH) + Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain platform with integrated DEX (Decentralized Exchange) functionality. The platform combines the verifiable delay functions of PoH with the energy efficiency of PoS to create a high-performance, secure, and scalable blockchain solution.

### Key Features

- **Hybrid PoH+PoS Consensus**: Combines Proof of History for verifiable time and sequencing with Proof of Stake for validator selection
- **High Performance**: Capable of processing thousands of transactions per second
- **Secure Wallet Management**: HD wallet support with BIP39 mnemonic seed phrases
- **Integrated DEX**: Built-in decentralized exchange functionality
- **P2P Network**: Robust peer-to-peer networking with automatic node discovery
- **Smart Contract Support**: Framework for deploying and executing smart contracts
- **Multi-token Support**: Native support for multiple token types and custom tokens

## Architecture

The Marble Blockchain architecture consists of several core components:

1. **Core Blockchain Module** (`marble_blockchain.py`):
   - Implements the main blockchain logic, consensus mechanism, and state management
   - Handles block production and validation
   - Manages the distributed ledger

2. **DEX Component** (`marble_dex_app.py`):
   - Provides APIs for token swaps, liquidity pools, and trading
   - Integrates with the Raydium V3 frontend
   - Supports analysis and validation of blockchain transactions

3. **CLI Interface** (`marble_cli.py`):
   - Interactive command-line interface for blockchain interaction
   - Support for wallet management, transactions, and blockchain queries
   - Direct integration with the DEX functionality

4. **Frontend UI** (Raydium V3 based):
   - Web-based interface for interacting with the Marble DEX
   - Customized Raydium UI with Marble branding
   - Advanced features for blockchain analysis and validation

### Data Flow

```
User → CLI/UI → Marble Blockchain Core → P2P Network → Validator Nodes
     ↓                  ↑
     → DEX Component ←
```

## Consensus Mechanism

Marble Blockchain employs a hybrid consensus mechanism combining Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS):

### Proof of History (PoH)

PoH is a high-frequency Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) that creates a historical record proving that data existed at a specific moment in time. Key aspects:

- Creates a sequential hash chain using SHA-256
- Each hash incorporates the previous hash, creating a verifiable sequence
- Provides a cryptographically secure clock for the network
- Enables parallel validation of transactions
- Timestamps transactions in a tamper-proof manner

### Proof of Stake (PoS)

PoS selects validators proportionally to their stake in the network. Key aspects:

- Validators stake MARBLE tokens as collateral
- Validator selection weighted by stake amount
- Energy-efficient alternative to Proof of Work
- Economic incentives for honest validation
- Slashing conditions for malicious behavior

### Hybrid Integration

The hybrid approach works as follows:

1. PoH maintains a verifiable sequence of events and timestamps
2. PoS selects validators for block production and confirmation
3. The leader (block producer) for each slot is selected by PoS
4. Transactions are ordered and timestamped by PoH
5. Validators confirm the PoH sequence and transaction validity
6. The network reaches consensus on the global state

This hybrid model delivers high throughput, fast finality, and strong security with minimal energy consumption.
